  content: "Hello! I am Nobe Mol and i made this project for DTT Multimedia, i had
    to show my programming skills making a maze.\n\nMy spin on it was to make 3 algorithms:
    Binary tree, Growing tree and Recursive backtracking.\n\nI implemented gpu instancing
    to reduce memory(no need for gameobjects, pure data) and allowing for mass batching
    to reduce GPU cost.\n\nI have only included the PC build, but there is mobile
    support if you'd build to it.\n\n\nIf there are any questions please ask me.
